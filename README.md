## Military Surplus Gear

County-level data showing military equipment given to state and local law enforcement agencies through the Defense Department's 1033 program. The data was received from the Defense Department in May 2014 as an Excel file, and includes transfers since 2006.

**Important**: There is no information about which agency received a given piece of equipment. Items that went to a county could have been given to a state agency based in that county, for example.

This data **does not represent all of the military-style gear that law enforcement agencies have**. Agencies also purchase equipment with their own money or with federal grants.
